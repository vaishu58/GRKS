Spin-up 3 servers in the AWS management console. 2 Servers are worker nodes and one server is manager node.
 Install docker on all the 3 Servers.
Initialise the docker swarm in the manager node.
Open port 2377 in the Security group for all the Servers.
Now Join both Network nodes o the manager node.
docker node ls 
https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/bandank/flask-calculator/general?trk=article-ssr-frontend-pulse_little-text-block
sudo docker service create --name flask-calculator --replicas 3 --publish 3000:3000 bandank/flask-calculator:latest
We can check the service that is created in the manager node server.
